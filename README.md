This plugin will attract mobs toward the last available cart on a TrainCarts train.
The attraction effect triggers whenever a train activates a "station" sign, but you can do it manually
with /call-passengers
I'll set up permissions and config stuff later.

It's recommended that you set mob/misc collision rules on trains to "enter".
It should be obvious by now that TrainCarts is required for this plugin to run.
